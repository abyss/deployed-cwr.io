I&amp;rsquo;ve always had thoughts of what I&amp;rsquo;d do with a website, but also realized that no one is interested enough in my thoughts to come to a website to read them. Then I would realize that I would have to pay a hosting fee and deal with a lot of HTML/CSS to design it properly (and boy am I picky). That was always enough to convince me not to do it.</description></item></channel></rss>
